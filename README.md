# Calculator
A simple calculator app built with React.js that does simple calculations and a couple conversions.

## Installation
You will need to install a recent version of Node.js on your machine to run the app.

Create a directory where you want to keep the project.

Open the terminal and cd into that directory.

Run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/chase-mack/calculator.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Features I will add in the future.
* Working Buttons for a Dark and Lite mode.
* A new design in Landscape mode.
* Active button state.
* Convert to mobile App.
